Application pages are organised in this folder. Each page corresponds to a route
configured in `App.jsx`.

- `Home.jsx` – basic landing page with some demo interactivity
- `About.jsx` – simple informational page
- `LongPageName.jsx` – used to test wrapping of long navigation labels
- `Reflection/` – optics related tools including interactive mirrors
